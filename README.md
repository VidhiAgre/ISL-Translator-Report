# Conversion of Indian Sign Language (ISL) to Text and Speech

This repository contains the **project report** for my mini-project titled **“Conversion of Indian Sign Language (ISL) to Text and Speech”**, submitted as part of the **Bachelor of Technology in Computer Engineering (2024–2025)** at **Usha Mittal Institute of Technology, SNDT Women’s University, Mumbai**.

---

## 🧠 Abstract

This project focuses on developing a **real-time AI system** that translates Indian Sign Language (ISL) gestures into **text and natural-sounding speech**.  

Using **MediaPipe Holistic** for hand, face, and body landmark detection and an **LSTM deep learning model** for sequential classification,the system accurately interprets ISL gestures and converts them into meaningful spoken sentences.

The model demonstrates strong performance across different lighting and background conditions,  
offering a robust solution for improving communication between the Deaf and hearing communities.
